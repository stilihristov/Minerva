Minerva - Guitar Effects using PureData and ALSA on Raspberry Pi
Bill Of Materials For the Project:
	The initial idea ensured that the inputed audio signal was converted with an ADC + passed through a preamp.
	A failure to get the right parts and materials led to using a simple external audio card - https://rlx.sk/en/breakout-boards-shields/4882-usb-20-51-audiocontroller-logilink.html
	- 1 Raspberry Pi 
	- 1 External USB Audio Card
	- 1 6mm to 3.5 audio adapter
	- 1 6mm caudio cable
	- 1 pair of headphones/speakers


Setup
	1. Connecting the USB audio card and setting up ALSA
	- Connecting the USB is pretty easy just plug it into 1 of the 4 available USB ports on the RASPBERRY microcontroller
	- Install the latest ALSA drivers for Raspbian. 
	
	Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) is a software framework and part of the Linux kernel that provides an application programming interface (API) for sound card device drivers.		
	
		sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
		sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835

	- Set external soundcard to default ALSA playback device\

		sudo amixer cset numid=3

	2. Setup PureData

	3. Run PureData

		sudo modprobe snd-pcm044

		sudo pd -rt -alsa -audiodev2,2 -autopatch -verbose -r 4800 -audiobug 32 - noadc -channels 2 -open reverb_effect.pd
